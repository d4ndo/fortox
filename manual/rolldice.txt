NAME
!roll or !r - rolls virtual dice

SYNOPSIS
!roll dice_string 
	
DICE STRING FORMAT
The dice string uses the following format:
{#x}{#}d[#|%]

{#}d[#|%]
This  is  the  only  required part of the string, and now
really isn't even required, as it defaults to 1d6 if  not
found.   The  first number is the number of dice to roll,
and the second number is the number  of  sides  the  dice
have.   The  numbers rolled on each die are then added up
and given as the result.  Hence  3d6  means  "roll  three
six-sided dice, add them together and return the result".
If the first number is left out, then the number of  dice
defaults to 1.  If the second number is not a number, but
a percentage sign, then the number of sides  becomes  100
(for a percentage roll).

{#x}
This  number  tells how many times to roll.  For example,
if you want to roll 3 6-sided dice 6 times, you would say
6x3d6.   This  would return six numbers, corresponding to
the six different rolls.

EXAMPLE
!roll 1d6
fortune: Roll #1: (6 ) = 6
